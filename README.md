# Wine Clustering Project
## In This Project we Will Use UnSupervised learning techniques to group the similar types of wine together.  
### Clustering Techniques:
<ul>
  <li>K-Means</li>
  <li>DBSCAN</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
This dataset is adapted from the Wine Data Set from <strong><a>https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine</a></strong> by removing the information about the types of wine for unsupervised learning.

The following descriptions are adapted from the UCI webpage:

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

The attributes are:

1. Alcohol
2. Malic acid
3. Ash
4. Alcalinity of ash
5. Magnesium
6. Total phenols
7. Flavanoids
8. Nonflavanoid phenols
9. Proanthocyanins
10. Color intensity
11. Hue
12. OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13. Proline
